# Project Euler

This project hosts my solutions to various Project Euler problems.

## How to run

Copy the directory to some desired location on your system, and run the python interpreter from `mainfile.py`

The `mainfile.py` file serves as the central entry point to execute solutions. Modify it as needed to run the desired solution.
