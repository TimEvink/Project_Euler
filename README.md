# Project Euler

This project hosts my Python solutions to various Project Euler problems.

## Directory Structure

```

```

## Requirements

Python V3.3+

## How to run

Copy the directory to some desired location on your system, and run the Python interpreter from `mainfile.py`

The `mainfile.py` file serves as the central entry point to execute solutions. Modify it as needed to run the desired solution.
