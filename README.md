# Project_Euler
Python code used for Project Euler problems.

Warning: name changes of the directory 'Python_codes', the subdirectory 'Some_modules', or any subdirectory of the subdirectory 'Some_modules' will break a lot of the code. This is due to some hard coding of the search path used to import modules from the 'Some_modules' directory, assuming the Python code is ran from the .py file corresponding to a specific Project Euler problem.
